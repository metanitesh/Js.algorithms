<b>big-O-notation</b> - can be used for time complexity comparison for algorithm

> **o(1)** - it is the ideal complexity. which means it does not depend on the size of data. same time will required to process, if dataset consist one or one million record.

> e.g. getting a value of an index in array is o(1) complexity operation. 

> **o(n)** - it is a linear complexity. which means if 10 record takes 1ms to processe 20 record will take 2ms.

> e.g. finding a record in an unsorted array is o(n) complexity operation

> **o(n2)** - it is a red alert complexity which genreally happens when nested loop is running on same data. if 10 record takes 5 second of processing 20 record will take 25 seconds

>e.g. poorly return sorting algoritm is o(n2) level complexity

there are other time complexities like nlogn, !n which is not faced commonly by a pragmatic application developer.
